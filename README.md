# Inventory Management System

A CLI application that allows businesses to keep track of their products, suppliers, and orders. 
This project incorporates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to interact with a database, and it will include three tables with a one-to-many relationship and one with a composite key. 
Users can manage their inventory, create purchase orders, and track product availability.
